## About Phishing in Education

Phishing remains one of the most common and effective cyber attack vectors targeting educational institutions. According to recent research, 83% of educational organizations faced at least one successful phishing attack in the past year.

Students and staff in educational environments are particularly vulnerable to phishing attacks due to:

1. Open communication culture
2. Regular sharing of documents and resources
3. Frequent legitimate requests for personal information
4. High turnover of students requiring regular account setup and verification

This educational game aims to address these challenges by providing a no-risk environment to practice identifying and responding to phishing attempts.
